A commonly discussed pain point of remote work is that it can feel more challenging or tiring than in-person collaboration. Researchers from our Human Factors Labs recently set out to understand this phenomenon. Do remote work and video meetings actually tax our brain more than in-person work? The brain science suggests, yes.

## Case Study: Microsoft MVP/RD Summit and Build

The COVID-19 pandemic quarantine went into place just a few weeks before Microsoft&#39;s annual Most Valuable Professional (MVP)/Regional Director (RD) Summit, planned for March 2020. This event brings together Microsoft executives, product leaders and developers with our Most Valuable Professional (MVP) and Regional Director (RD) communities and serves all Microsoft product areas including Azure, Microsoft 365 and Business Applications Groups. With planning horizon of only a few weeks, we shifted to summit to a Digital Event, producing the event with Microsoft Teams and hosting the Summit in a Microsoft Team in Microsoft&#39;s production environment.

In the late spring of 2020, Microsoft hosted their annual Build conference as a completely digital event. Watch Microsoft CVP of global events, Bob Bejan, in a behind-the-scenes look at how Microsoft transitioned its flagship developer conference into a fully virtual event experience.

## Digital Events Key Learnings

We learned four critical things from a year of shifting all our flagship conferences and events to a digital experience:

**1. Don&#39;t Translate, Remake**
- Don&#39;t attempting to deliver a traditional in-person event virtually by assuming the only change will be to shift from conference center breakout rooms to online meetings.
- Because the space between presenter and attendee has compressed from venue hall to laptop distance, digital events are more intimate, more authentic, and require a different approach to ensure success.

**2. Re-think your runway**
- With a virtual event, there are no travel and entertainment costs for attendees, and as a result no &quot;cost&quot; to attending the event early. 
- The attendee experience and engagement begins before the actual digital event begins, and continues after. Your digital event platform should include a toolset that allows engagement outside the timeframe of your actual event.

**3. Earn attention, Keep attention**
- As we learned in the COVID-19 pandemic, back-to-back online meetings create real fatigue and impact wellness. 
- Shorter content sessions with frequent are better. Downloadable deep-dive content and reference information for follow-up after the event can offset the shorter sessions.

**4. Connect with your audience**
- Leverage interstitial content and a &quot;hero stream&quot; to anchor the attendee experience can ensure a connection throughout the event, while social media, in-session chat and event communities can drive ongoing connection with the audience.
